# Concepts
## Premise
Main game concept is ever-changing environment and unescapable danger to which you should always prepare. 

## Noland
Outside world is hostile, and alive. Nothing is what it seems to be, even rocks are whispering behind your back. Also beware of Darkness. It's always coming, trying to wrap its hands around you.

Some say that it treats everyone separately, having its own mind.

There's plenty of phenomena happening: rocks creating splittings and closing them regularly, thus making passages; anomalies that make materials take strange shapes, or fly in tornado-like formations.

## Wagon
Player character is able to move away from it by drill they should maintain. It's a small hub and single thing that could keep you alive underground.

Wagons moving from station to station is the way of living for humans, providing food and other supplies.

Wagon design is inspired by arctic expedition vehicles such as Kharkovchanka, its tracked.

## Stations
Were made as research and production facilities at some point, but now are last safe havens barely making ends.

## Character
Their body is always in suit that somehow protects from heat loss and other environment elements. Its servos allow for moving heavy equipment around and repair the wagon quickly in the field.
