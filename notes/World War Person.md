# World War Person

Speech details: all caps, every word is color marked depending on connotation. For example, "bad" is red, "good" is green, using "we" and speaking about themselves by addressing from third person.

Episode: Stumbling upon a corpse that is always there and about which they forget about. They treat it as "half-alive"

> world war is already over - we already won - we took out all the nation states without hurting anybody - we are the caretakes of the whole human race - we are in charge of humanity

> DROID [PERSON's NAME] IS A REALLY BIG DEAL
